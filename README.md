This project is used to create a complete Todo List on the browser

First, we need to use DOM to get the form, since user will actually submit a form to the browser, and click the button to add new Todo item. Our form needs to add an event, inside prevent default method to stop the form from refreshing. We need to get the value from user input, and render todo, and set empty string after input.
